# Web Development Study Guide

## Description

The motivation behind this project was to provide a comprehensive cheat sheet to all budding web developers who may be struggling with HTML, CSS and JavaScript. I built this webpage in hopes that it will help save time and energy by keeping common references and tips all in one place. Building this page and the information in it has taught me much in foundational web development and I believe it will continue to help those new to the field, like I am, as they progress through their studies.

## Usage

This webpage was designed to be a study guide, where topics can easily be referred to under 'HTML', 'CSS', 'Git', and 'JavaScript'. Each section will display a list of information about each topic that can help you progress as a developer. If the information under each topic is overwhelming to study multiple topics each day, you can use the Developer Tools / Console in your browser to not only view JavaScript in action but to help you decide which topic to study today!
